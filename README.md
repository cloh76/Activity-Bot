# Activity Code for KuyaBot

Activity Bot Code (Activity Leveling and Economy System for KuyaBot)

Code for adding features to the Steem Philippines Community Bot - KuyaBot.

This portion of Code is being created seperately using DBM and DBM Mod components to simplify and organize the coding process.  These features are being built seperately to test functionality to minimize issues and conflicts with current KuyaBot code.  Once all functionality is coded and bot is functioning properly, The KuyaBot code will be ported over to unify and consolidate all features.

Once the code has been beta tested in the SteemPH Discord Server (Currently in Progress) and is free of any issues or bugs, It will be added to the existing KuyaBot Code which can be found <a href ="https://github.com/cloh76/KuyaBot">HERE</a>.
